public interface CompoundType {

	// Dictionary definitions: a Compound is something that
	// is composed or made up of different elements or parts
	// in a particular/specific ratio
	
	// yes: a quaternion, a complex number, an rgb color, etc
	
	// no: a vector or matrix or tensor
	//   one, their sizes vary
	//   two they are considered a CompositeType
	
	// you can have a CompositeType made a CompoundTypes
	//   for instance a matrix (a CompositeType) of complex numbers
	//   (a CompoundType)
	
	// in other words a CompoundType is a U that has components
	
	// TODO: improve the type inference we support. Imagine we have
	//   a vector of complex doubles. We should query the outer algebra
	//   to see it is a composite type. And it is composed of the
	//   CompoundType complex number. Use the outer algebra to somehow
	//   get the inner algebra of the compound type made of Float64s.
	//   As it is defined now this is not really connected. Complex
	//   numbers are not CompoundTypes of Float64s. We need more
	//   expansive generics. Also note you could have a composite type
	//   of a compound type and that compound type might have a 
	//   composite type in it etc. This can get arbitrarily complex.
	//   And a smart type inference engine could figure out the best
	//   way to display such complex data.
