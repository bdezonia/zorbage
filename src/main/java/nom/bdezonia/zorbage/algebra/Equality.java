	// TODO: do these prev two methods belong in their own Zero interface that algebras
	// must implement? Are there real life algebras that don't have a zero/ground element?
	// Answer: the natural numbers have no zero. And no subtraction. But do have add. The
	// algebra hierarchy as is has some small holes. negate() should only apply to algebras
	// that have zero and subtraction and maybe a sense of negative values (so unsigned
	// algebras would not implement negate. Right now they handle it but do nothing. Either
	// approach might be fine.). Another hole: Addition interface includes subtraction when
	// I've just demonstrated maybe they should not.
