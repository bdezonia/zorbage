		//   requests like this and allocates the best data structure for the job. It will first
		//   try to allocate an in memory structure (one that is allowed to grow beyond 2 gig in
		//   memory use). This structure is fast and completely contained in RAM so if your Java
		//   heap size is large enough (which is configurable by a user of your application) the
		//   storage allocator will generate one. If you do not have enough RAM for a complete
		//   in memory data structure the storage allocator will return a file based list that
		//   contains a 4K byte memory buffer. All the values of the list are paged to a file on
		//   disk as needed. The created list is zero filled. This access is much slower than RAM
		//   access but can allocate mind boggling large lists of data.

		//   FillSerially will repeatedly call it; once per element in the array of data. We fill in
		//   a serial (first to last order) fashion because the big data sources perform better
		//   that way. The basic Fill algorithm works parallelly and is designed for in memory data
		//   structures.

		//   it is limited to the amount of physical RAM allocated to the JVM. But you can configure the
		//   your JVM to use as much RAM as possible and the BigList will tap into it bypassing the
		//   2 gig limit on the number of elements in RAM for one list.

		// One issue with working with lots of data is that doing math with many numbers can result
		// in overflows or underflows or losses of precision. One trick Zorbage uses is to allow
		// one to accumulate values in high precision floating point numbers. The precision of which
		// can be set between 1 and 4000 decimal places. These numbers maintain said precision and
		// are unbounded so they do not over/underflow.

		// Allocate a 16 bit unsigned value to pass to the storage allocator

		// Fill it with random data

		Fill.compute(G.UINT16, G.UINT16.random(), data);

		// Let's pull out values as unbounded floating point numbers that can't lose precision. We wrap the
		// original data in a filter that reads values in the original data type and converts the result to
		// a high precision value.

		IndexedDataSource<HighPrecisionMember> filter = new ReadOnlyHighPrecisionDataSource<>(G.UINT16, data);

		// Let's set the decimal place accuracy we want to maintain. Ideally this is called once by your

		HighPrecisionMember mean = G.HP.construct();
