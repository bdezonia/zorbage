Examples
  UnboundedIntMember
  Parsing all kinds of types
  Mandelbrot explorer
  Game of life
  
Other needs
  make all int[] indices into long[] indices
  Multiplying together vectors, matrices, and tensors
  Fix and flesh out tensor classes
  Matrices: norm, det, invert
  Octs: log
  Storage: multidimension facades
  Add more types:
    native long, short, byte, float32, plus complex32
    bit: 2, 4, 12, 20, 24, 128
    int types above as both signed and unsigned
  Add tests
  polynomials
  group ring, modules
  vector direct product creating tensors
  many many more converters needed
    1 per type combo
    additional for float based types: add all the rounding methods
    extract i, j, k, l, i0, j0, k0
  improve exp() and log() accuracy near 1.0 / - 1.0
  big decimal type needed?
  a tensor like class that can support quats and octs not as vector spaces but rmodules
  number bases: instead of zero and unity need faster ways to construct numbers besides strings
  implement all type toString() methods for tensors
  find all TODOs in code and implement
  implement Power(U,U.U) where it makes sense. also sqrt and cbrt part of Power interface?
  power(int, a, b): minimize number of multiplies via recursion. see boost hpp code for quats and octs.
    implement this for all numeric types.
