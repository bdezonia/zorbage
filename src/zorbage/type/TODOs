Examples
  UnboundedIntMember
  Parsing all kinds of types
  Mandelbrot explorer
  Game of life
  
Other needs
  Multiplying together vectors, matrices, and tensors
  Choose round nearest: rint() vs. round()
  Flesh out tensor classes
  Matrices: norm, det, invert
  Storage: multidimension facades
  Fix numeric parsing
  Add more types: short, byte, 12 bit, etc
  Add tests
  polynomials
  group ring, modules
  vector direct product creating tensors
  many many more converters needed
    1 per type combo
    additional for float based types: add all the rounding methods
    extract i, j, k, l, i0, j0, k0
  improve exp() and log() accuracy near 1.0 / - 1.0
  big decimal type needed?
  a tensor like class that can support quats and octs not as vector spaces but rmodules
