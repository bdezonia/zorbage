Examples
  UnboundedIntMember
  Parsing all kinds of types
  Mandelbrot explorer
  Game of life
  
Other needs
  make all int[] indices into long[] indices
  Multiplying together vectors, matrices, and tensors: roundNearest() vs roundNearestEven()
  Choose round nearest: rint() vs. round()
  Fix and flesh out tensor classes
  Matrices: norm, det, invert
  Storage: multidimension facades
  Fix numeric parsing
  Add more types:
    native long, short, byte, float32, plus complex32
    bit: 2, 4, 12, 20, 24, 128
    int types above made both signed and unsigned
  Add tests
  polynomials
  group ring, modules
  vector direct product creating tensors
  many many more converters needed
    1 per type combo
    additional for float based types: add all the rounding methods
    extract i, j, k, l, i0, j0, k0
  improve exp() and log() accuracy near 1.0 / - 1.0
  big decimal type needed?
  a tensor like class that can support quats and octs not as vector spaces but rmodules
  storage containers should be able to duplicate themselves
  number bases: instead of zero and unity need faster ways to construct numbers besides strings
  implement all type toString() methods like matrices, tensors, vectors
  find all TODOs in code and implement
  add random() to all numeric float classes generating vales between 0 and 1 for all components
  implement Power(U,U.U) where it makes sense. also sqrt and cbrt part of Power interface?
  since all the numeric types need a multidim safe hypot method implement one
