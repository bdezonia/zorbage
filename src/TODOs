Examples
  Parsing all kinds of types
  Mandelbrot explorer
  Game of life
  
Other needs
  maven
  Multiplying together vectors, matrices, and tensors
  Fix and flesh out tensor classes
  Matrices: norm (more than one kind), det, invert
  Add more types:
    native long, short, byte, float32, plus complex32 and quat32 and oct32
    bit: 2, 4, 12, 20, 24, 128
    int types above as both signed and unsigned
  Add tests
  polynomials
  group ring, modules
  functions of a real variable as a vector space
  vector direct product creating tensors
  improve exp() and log() accuracy near 1.0 / - 1.0
  big decimal type needed?
  number bases: instead of zero and unity need faster ways to construct numbers besides strings
  find all TODOs in code and implement
  implement Power(U,U,U) where it makes sense. also sqrt and cbrt part of Power interface?
  power(int, a, b): minimize number of multiplies via recursion. see boost hpp code for quats and octs.
    implement this for all numeric types.
  real/unreal as part of hierarchy. at least unreal.
  make sure all math ops can safely work if (a,b,c) params collide. use extra tmps and assign().
  check: IEEE 754 might specify that a num with one component inf and any nan might be considered inf.
    This affects complex, quat, and oct. Now I assume a nan overrides all.
  complex numbers: polar constructors
  quotient/remainder as well as div/mod
  make interface DimensionallyConstructable to support things like
    defining arrays and matrices and tensors with specified shape
  make Constructible interfaces from primitive types
  there are numerous kinds of norms. can embed a default impl for some types. but should implement
    families of reusable norm implementations
  group hierarchy could be multithreaded
  must finish tensor classes
  must finish octonion classes
  must finish rmodule classes
  does a strong differentiation between rmodule and vector hurt reuse? can the shared concepts
    between them be better identified and implemented to make general algos more likely?
  numerical algorithms put in place: matrix algebra, odes, pdes, interpolation, etc.
  underflow avoidance on sqrt calls
  bessel functions, legendre functions, airy functions, others
