The EquationParser class can create Procedures from text string equations.
Information about the supported language follows.

Supported operators:

  +  (addition)
  -  (subtraction)
  *  (multiplication)
  /  (division)
  %  (mod)
  ^  (power)

Accessing input variables:

  $<int>
  
    Parsed equations are instances of Procedure<U>. Their call signature looks
    like:
    
      void call(U result, U... inputs)
      
    Using $2 in an equation string directs the parser to substitute inputs[2]
    into the calculation at the spot the $2 is defined.
  
Defining numbers:

  Numbers are integers and decimals. They can start with an optional sign (+
  or -) and are then followed by a string of digits. They can be then be
  followed with an optional decimal fraction starting with a period (.).
  Finally a number can also have an exponent value on the end.
  
  Some examples:
  
    1
    +505
    -4132
    2.2
    5.7e-3 (= 0.0057)
    4.5e+5 (= 450000)
    -12e2  (= -1200)
    
Defining complex / quaternion / octonion values:

  Numbers with more then one component are captured between { } brackets
  using commas.
  
  For example:
  
    {1,2} = 1 + 2i
    {1,2,3,4} = 1 + 2i + 3j + 4k
    {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} = 1 + 2i + 3j + 4k + 5l + 6i0 + 7j0 + 8k0
    
    The individual components can be any valid decimal number as defined
    above.

Defining vectors / matrices / tensors:

  Higher dimensional numerics are specified by placing values between [ ]
  markers separated by commas.
  
  A 3 component vector of integers: [1,2,3]
  
  A 2x2 matrix of complex values: [[{1,2},{3,4}][{5,6},{7,8}]]

Grouping terms as desired:

  You can use parentheses in an equation to order the operations as you
  desire.
  
  3.0 * ($0 + $1)
    
    Multiply the sum of input[0] and input[1] by 3.0.
    
Supported constants:

  E
  PI
  GAMMA
  PHI
  I
  J
  K
  L
  I0
  J0
  K0

  max(a,b)

    Returns the greater of it's two arguments
    
  min(a,b)

    Returns the lesser of it's two arguments

  rand
  
    Returns a random value in the range of the backing type of the equation.
    For instance if the backing type is 64 bit floats then it will return
    a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but excluding 1.0). If the
    backing type is signed 4 bit integers then the random value will be
    in the range -8 to 7 inclusive.

  sin(a)
  
    Compute the sine of a

  sinc(a)

    Returns the value sin(x) / x
    
  sinch(a)

    Returns the value sinh(x) / x

  sinchpi(a)

    Returns the value sinh(x * PI) / (x * PI)

  sincpi(a)

    Returns the value sin(x * PI) / (x * PI)

  sinh(a)
  
    Compute the hyperbolic sine of a

  sqrt(a)
  
    Compute the square root of a

  tan(a)
  
    Compute the tangent of a

  tanh(a)
  
    Compute the hyperbolic tangent of a

  tmax
  
    Returns a constant whose value is equal to the maximum for the type that
    backs the equation. For instance if the algebra passed to the equation
    parser was for unsigned 8 bit numbers then tmax would equal 255.

  tmin
  
    Returns a constant whose value is equal to the minimum for the type that
    backs the equation. For instance if the algebra passed to the equation
    parser was for signed 16 bit numbers then tmin would equal -32768.
 
 Some examples
 
   4 * $0 + 7
   
     Scale input[0] by 4 and add 7
     
   {1,2}^{3,4}
   
     Raise complex number 1+2i to the 3+4i power
     
   tmin + 0.42 * tmax
