Zorbage: an algebraic data hierarchy for use in numeric processing

Goals:
  1) provide the framework for reusable numeric algorithms
  2) support numeric computing in Java in an efficient manner

Support for:
  1) integers, reals, complex numbers, quaternions, octonions
  2) numbers, vectors, matrices, and tensors
  3) various precisions: 1-bit to 128-bit
  4) generic programming
  5) group theoretical algorithms
  6) procedural, object oriented, and (coming soon) functional styles
