Zorbage: an algebraic data hierarchy for use in numeric processing

Goals:
  1) provide the framework for reusable numeric algorithms
  2) support numeric computing in Java in an efficient manner

Support for:
  1) integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers, quaternions, octonions
  2) numbers, vectors, matrices, and tensors
  3) various precisions: 1-bit to 128-bit (signed and unsigned and float)
  4) very large datasets (arrays, virtual files, sparse structures, JDBC storage)
  5) generic programming
  6) alebraic/group-theoretic algorithms
  7) procedural, object oriented, and functional coding styles
