Zorbage: algebraic data types and algorithms for use in numeric processing

Goals:
  1) provide the framework for reusable numeric algorithms
  2) support numeric computing in Java in an efficient manner

Support for:
  1) integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers, quaternions, octonions
  2) numbers, vectors, matrices, and tensors
  3) various precisions: 1-bit to 128-bit to unbounded (signed and unsigned and float)
  4) very large datasets (arrays, virtual files, sparse structures, JDBC storage)
  5) generic programming
  6) algebraic/group-theoretic algorithms
  7) procedural java with object oriented comforts

What can I do with Zorbage?

  Define multidimensional data sets with flexible out of bounds data
    handling procedures.
    
  Use many different data types

    signed integers (bits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                           14, 15, 16, 32, 64, 128, unbounded)

    unsigned integers (bits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                           14, 15, 16, 32, 64, 128)

    floats (bits: 16, 32, 64, unbounded)

    rational numbers (unbounded)
  
    booleans
    
    n-dimensional real Points
    
    ARGB and RGB tuples
  
  A conversion api exists for moving between types accurately and efficiently.
  
  There are types that are compound: complex numbers, quaternions, and
    octonions based on any of the floating types.
    
  Types can be stored in arrays, files, sparse structures, and JDBC
    database tables.
    
  You can allocate and use huge (length Long.MAX_VAUE) data structures.
  
  Data access is standardized as if everything is an array. Arrays can be
    concatenated, trimmed, subsampled, masked, padded, readonly, as well as
    other abstractions.
      
  Array storage can be in native types (for speed of access) or for many
    integer types they can be bit encoded (to save space).
  
  You can use existing or write your own generic algorithms that work with
    all the types transparently. For instance Zorbage has one Sort algorithm
    that can sort a list made of any of the above defined types while doing
    no data conversions.
  
  You can use existing or write your own algorithms that work with numbers,
    vectors, matrices, and tensors. Zorbage includes 100's of predefined
    algorithms too.
    - Basic vector and matrix operations
    - Calculate sin/cos/tan/sinh/cosh/tanh/exp of matrices
    - Basic runge kutta ode solver
    - FFT/InvFFT
    - Convolution/Correlation
    - Resamplers
    - LUDecomp
    - Many C++ STL algorithms replicated
    - It can find roots, find derivatives, and solve differential
        equations numerically involving arbitrary scalar and vector
        Procedures. It also includes algorithms from linear algebra,
        signal processing, statistics, set theory, and analysis.
    - Use Zorbage's parallel algorithms for quickly processing data.
  
  Define complex data sampling algorithms from prebuilt sampling components.
  
  Use type safe first class Function and Procedure objects. Pass them as
    arguments to code that can transform your data quickly and generically.
    Write methods that return Functions and Procedures if needed.
 
  Use parsers to create Procedures from strings. These Procedures represent
    equations that when fed values will compute a return value (the result of
    applying the inputs to the equation). Equations can return numbers, vectors,
    matrices, or tensors. The subcomponents of these can be reals, complexes,
    quaternions, or octonions. Equations can be built out of numbers, input
    variable references, constants (like E, PI, etc.) and typical functions
    like sin(), atan(), exp(), log(), etc. For more info see:

Why Java?

  - numerical computing in Java is under represented
  - with Java there is no need to worry about memory or pointer bugs
  - the JRE optimizes many object allocations into stack allocations
  - Java is portable: Zorbage runs everywhere the JVM does

Why is Zorbage the way it is?

  - procedural programming is efficient
  - object oriented comforts can be used where needed
  - generics allow for reusable algorithms. often one can write one
      algorithm and use it for reals, complex numbers, quaternions,
      etc.
  - there is no telling what one bored developer can get up to when
      looking for fun
  
Zorbage breaks Java barriers
  
  - in Zorbage "arrays" are indexed by longs rather than ints.
      relatedly data lists sizes can reach Long.MAX_VALUE
    
  - breaks the limitation to integer types being in byte aligned sizes
    
  - supports unsigned numbers
    
  - supports 128-bit signed and unsigned integers
    
  - supports 16-bit floating numbers
    
  - supports high precision floating numbers
    
  - supports unbounded ints
    
  - supports (unbounded) rational numbers
    
  - builds reals, complexes, quaternions, and octonions from any
      of the floating types
    
Zorbage is fast
  
  - Zorbage can run numeric algorithms in speeds comparable to C++
    
  - Some multithreaded algorithms are provided
      - matrix multiplies
      - resampling
      - convolutions/correlations
      - fills
      - transforms

Zorbage is flexible
  
  - supports n-dimensional data sets with flexible out of bounds data
      handling procedures
      
  - the n-dimensional data sets can use the equational language to
      carefully and powerfully calibrate their axes.
